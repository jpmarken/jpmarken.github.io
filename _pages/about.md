I am an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow based in the [Section of Microbiology](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/microbiology/) at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by Søren Sørensen. My work integrates theoretical, experimental, and policy-based approaches to develop a rigorous foundation for understanding and engineering microbial interactions in real-world environments, with a particular focus on horizontal gene transfer.

Prior to my current position, I was at Caltech for 8 years where I did a PhD in Bioengineering supervised by [Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page) and a postdoc supervised by [Bruce Hay](https://haylab.caltech.edu/). Please see the [Research](/research/) and [Public Policy](/policy/) pages for more information on my past and current work.

Before that, I was at the College of William and Mary where I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. I participated heavily in the [iGEM competition](https://igem.org/) there, as a member of the 2015 and 2016 teams and a supervisor of the 2017 team. I was also a member of the iGEM Measurement Committee for the 2018 season, where I helped conduct the [iGEM Interlab Study](https://technology.igem.org/interlabs/introduction).
