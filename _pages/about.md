I am an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow based in the [Section of Microbiology](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/microbiology/) at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by Søren Sørensen. My work integrates theoretical, experimental, and policy-based approaches to develop a rigorous foundation for understanding and engineering microbial interactions in real-world environments, with a particular focus on horizontal gene transfer.

Prior to my current position, I was at Caltech for 8 years where I did a PhD in Bioengineering supervised by [Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page) and a postdoc supervised by [Bruce Hay](https://haylab.caltech.edu/). Please see the [Research](/research/) and [Public Policy](/policy/) pages for more information on my past and current work.

Before that, I was at the College of William and Mary where I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. I participated heavily in the [iGEM competition](https://igem.org/) there, as a member of the 2015 and 2016 teams and a supervisor of the 2017 team. I was also a member of the iGEM Measurement Committee for the 2018 season, where I helped conduct the [iGEM Interlab Study](https://technology.igem.org/interlabs/introduction).


<!-- I am a Resnick Sustainability Institute postdoctoral scholar at Caltech supervised by [Bruce Hay](https://haylab.caltech.edu/). My work aims to develop a rigorous foundation for translating synthetic biology advances beyond the laboratory and into application contexts, with a particular focus on sustainability applications.

I approach this goal from both the engineering angle, by designing architectures for robust genetic circuit performance and developing theoretical frameworks for analyzing biomolecular systems, and from the scientific angle, by studying fundamental questions about how microbial physiology impacts the behavior of genetic circuits. Please see the [Research](/research/) page for more details.

I also work with the Linde Center for Science, Society, and Policy to advocate for reform in the U.S. microbial biotechnology regulatory system to better promote innovation and safety in the synthetic biology industry. Please see the [Public Policy](/policy/) page for more details.
